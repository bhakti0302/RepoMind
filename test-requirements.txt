# Employee Management System Requirements

## Overview
We need to implement a feature to manage departments in our employee management system.

## Requirements
1. Create a Department class that will store department information
2. The Department class should have the following properties:
   - id (integer)
   - name (string)
   - location (string)
   - budget (double)
   - manager (string)

3. The Department class should include appropriate getters and setters for all properties
4. The Department class should include a toString method that displays all department information

## Implementation Details
The Department class should be created in the src directory and should be part of the com.employee package.
