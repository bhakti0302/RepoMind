Add a method getEmployeesByDepartment to /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java:

public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
    return employees.stream()
                    .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))
                    .toList();
}

Add code to /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java:

String targetDepartment = "HR";
System.out.println("\nEmployees in " + targetDepartment + " Department:");
for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {
    System.out.println(e);
}
