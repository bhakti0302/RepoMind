Create a method in /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java:

```java
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
    return employees.stream()
                    .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))
                    .toList();
}
```

Add code to /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java after line 20:

```java
String targetDepartment = "HR";
System.out.println("\nEmployees in " + targetDepartment + " Department:");
for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {
    System.out.println(e);
}
```

Replace the toString method in /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java with:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Employee{" +
            "id=" + id +
            ", name='" + name + '\'' +
            ", department='" + department + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```
