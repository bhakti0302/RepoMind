1. Add the following method to the EmployeeService class in /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java:

```java
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
    return employees.stream()
                    .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))
                    .toList();
}
```

2. Add the following code to the main method in /Users/sakshi/Documents/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java after the line with "String department = scanner.nextLine();":

```java
String targetDepartment = "HR";
System.out.println("\nEmployees in " + targetDepartment + " Department:");
for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {
    System.out.println(e);
}
```
