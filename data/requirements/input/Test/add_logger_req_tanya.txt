Enhance the existing TestTanya.java class by adding comprehensive logging functionality:

1. Add a Java Logger instance to the class
2. Add appropriate log statements at the entry and exit points of all methods
3. Log important parameter values and return values
4. Include different log levels (INFO, WARNING, FINE) based on the importance of the log message
5. Add error handling with appropriate logging for exceptional cases
6. Ensure the logging implementation follows Java logging best practices
7. The logging should not interfere with the existing functionality of the class

The existing TestTanya.java class is located at Test/src/TestTanya.java and contains methods for processing string data.
