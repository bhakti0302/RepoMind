# RepoMind Product Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the RepoMind project.

## Current Status

RepoMind currently provides:
- Code analysis and chunking
- Dependency graph generation
- Basic visualizations of code relationships
- VS Code extension with chat interface

## Upcoming Features

### Epic: Interactive Visualization Customization

**Description:** Allow users to customize visualizations through natural language chat interface, enabling them to focus on specific classes or components of interest.

**Target Release:** Q3 2023

**Tasks:**
1. **Implement Chatbot Visualization Commands**
   - Add natural language processing for visualization requests
   - Create a command parser for visualization parameters
   - Implement response templates for visualization requests

2. **Create Class Focus Feature**
   - Develop functionality to highlight specific classes requested by the user
   - Implement filtering of visualizations based on class names
   - Add depth parameter to control how many related classes to include

3. **Add Relationship Filtering**
   - Allow users to filter visualizations by relationship types (extends, implements, uses)
   - Implement commands to show only specific relationships
   - Add ability to combine multiple relationship filters

4. **Enhance Visualization Rendering**
   - Improve layout algorithms for better visualization clarity
   - Add zoom levels for large codebases
   - Implement collapsible node groups for package-level views

5. **Create Visualization Presets**
   - Develop common visualization presets (inheritance only, dependency only)
   - Allow users to save and name custom visualization configurations
   - Implement preset sharing between team members

### Epic: Enhanced Visualization Types

**Description:** Add more visualization types to provide different perspectives on the codebase.

**Target Release:** Q4 2023

**Tasks:**
1. **Add Sequence Diagram Generation**
   - Implement method call sequence visualization
   - Create interactive sequence diagrams
   - Add ability to trace execution paths

2. **Create Component Diagrams**
   - Develop high-level component visualization
   - Show interactions between major system components
   - Implement filtering by component type

3. **Add Metrics Visualization**
   - Visualize code complexity metrics
   - Create heatmaps of code activity
   - Implement trend visualizations for code changes

4. **Implement Dynamic Visualizations**
   - Add animation capabilities to show code evolution
   - Create time-based visualizations of code changes
   - Implement "diff" visualizations between versions

5. **Add 3D Visualization Options**
   - Explore 3D visualization of complex codebases
   - Implement interactive 3D navigation
   - Create VR/AR visualization options for large projects

## Long-term Vision

The long-term vision for RepoMind includes:

1. **AI-Powered Code Understanding**
   - Automatic identification of design patterns
   - Intelligent suggestions for code organization
   - Predictive analysis of code quality issues

2. **Collaborative Code Exploration**
   - Real-time collaborative visualization sessions
   - Shared annotations and comments on visualizations
   - Team-based code exploration tools

3. **Integration with Development Workflow**
   - Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines
   - Automatic visualization updates on code changes
   - Integration with code review processes

4. **Cross-Language Visualization**
   - Unified visualization of polyglot codebases
   - Language-agnostic code relationship mapping
   - Support for all major programming languages
