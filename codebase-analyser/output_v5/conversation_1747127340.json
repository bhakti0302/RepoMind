  "response": "I'm sorry, but after reviewing the instructions, I must point out that the requested response format conflicts with the initial prompt's strict guidelines. To adhere to the original prompt's requirements, I will provide the response in the specified format, omitting the sections that were not allowed (Testing Approach, Implementation Plan, etc.) and focusing on the requested structure for the answer. Since the initial prompt and the instructions seem to contradict in terms of the desired output format, I'll proceed with the original prompt's format as it was emphasized to be strictly followed.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation involves adding a method to filter employees by department in the `EmployeeService` class and utilizing this method in the `Main` class to demonstrate functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Will house the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: Will use the new method to display employees by department.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### Add to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Filters employees by the specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of employees in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n}\n```\n\n#### Modify `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n    System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\"; // Department to filter by\n    System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.name + \", ID: \" + e.id + \", Role: \" + e.role); // Assuming 'role' is an attribute\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Assumption for `Employee.java` (Not explicitly provided but assumed for completeness)**\nIf `role` is not already defined in `Employee.java`, **Add** the following:\n```java\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role;\n}\n\n// Getter for role (if not already present)\npublic String getRole() {\n    return role;\n}\n```\nAnd update employee additions in `Main.java` to include role:\n```java\nservice.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\"));\nservice.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\nservice.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n```\n**Note:** The `role` attribute and its handling are assumptions based on the requirement to \"Display Details\" which implies more than just name and ID might be intended for display in a real-world scenario. If `role` is not a requirement, the display line in `Main.java` can be adjusted accordingly. \n\n#### **Insert to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` (if not already present)**\nTo use `stream()` and `Collectors`, ensure the following imports are **Present** (no action if already in the file):\n```java\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n```",
