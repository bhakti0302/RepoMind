Filter by Department\n   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\", \"HR\").\n   - The system should display all employees working in that department.\n\n2. Display Details\n   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.\n\nSuggested Code Enhancements:\n- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.\n- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.\n\n# Context\n\n--- Document 1: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\n--- Document 2: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n--- Document 3: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\n\n\n        for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n\n--- Document 4: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n\n--- Document 5: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\n\n--- Document 6: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java ---\n\npublic String getDepartment() { return department; }\n\n--- Document 7: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java ---\n\n\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n--- Document 8: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java ---\n\npublic class Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private String department;\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() { return id; }\n    public String getName() { return name; }\n    public String getDepartment() { return department; }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee{id=\" + id + \", name='\" + name + \"', department='\" + department + \"'}\";\n    }\n}\n\n--- Document 9: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nBased on the provided requirements and context, implement the necessary code changes.\n\nPlease provide your implementation in the following format:\n\n## File: [file_path]\n\n```[language]\n// Your code here\n```\n\n",
  "response": "Based on the provided requirements and context, here are the necessary code changes to implement the \"Display Employees by Department\" functionality:\n\n### **Step 1: Enhance `EmployeeService` with `getEmployeesByDepartment`**\n\n#### ## File: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all employees belonging to a specific department.\n     * \n     * @param department Name of the department to filter by\n     * @return List of Employees in the specified department\n     */\n    public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n        return employees.stream()\n                .filter(e -> e.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Step 2: Modify `Main` to Demonstrate Filtering Functionality**\n\n#### ## File: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n\n```java\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\nimport com.company.model.Employee; // Ensure this import is present\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n\n        // Example Employees for Demonstration\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"John Doe\", \"Engineering\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Jane Doe\", \"HR\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Bob Smith\", \"Engineering\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(4, \"Alice Johnson\", \"HR\"));\n\n        // Display all employees (for context)\n        System.out.println(\"### All Employees ###\");\n        for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n\n        // Filter and Display by Department\n        String targetDepartment = \"Engineering\"; // Example Department\n        System.out.println(\"\\n### Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" ###\");\n        List<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n        if (!departmentEmployees.isEmpty()) {\n            for (Employee e : departmentEmployees) {\n                // Displaying name, ID, and role as per requirements (Note: Role not provided in initial model, using department as placeholder)\n                System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role (Department): \" + e.getDepartment());\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"No employees found in the '\" + targetDepartment + \"' department.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Notes on Implementation:**\n\n- **Case Insensitivity**: The `getEmployeesByDepartment` method uses `equalsIgnoreCase` to ensure the department filter is case-insensitive.\n- **Stream API**: Utilized for concise filtering in `getEmployeesByDepartment`.\n- **Example Employees**: Added in `Main` for demonstration purposes. In a real application, these would typically come from a database or another data source.\n- **Role Display**: Since the `Employee` model does not include a `role` attribute as per the provided context, the department is used as a placeholder in the output format. **You should add a `role` field to the `Employee` model and adjust the output accordingly**:\n  \n  #### ## File: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Updated)\n\n  ```java\n  public class Employee {\n      private int id;\n      private String name;\n      private String department;\n      private String role; // New field\n\n      public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n          this.id = id;\n          this.name = name;\n          this.department = department;\n          this.role = role; // Initialize role\n      }\n\n      // Existing getters...\n      public String getRole() { return role; } // New getter\n\n      @Override\n      public String toString() {\n          return \"Employee{id=\" + id + \", name='\" + name + \"', department='\" + department + \"', role='\" + role + \"'}\";\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  Then, update the `Main` class to include `role` when creating `Employee` instances and display it:\n\n  ```java\n  service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"John Doe\", \"Engineering\", \"Software Engineer\"));\n  // ...\n  System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: \" + e.getRole());\n  ```\n\n### **Additional Recommendations (Not Requested but Useful):**\n\n- **Input Validation**: Add checks in `getEmployeesByDepartment` to handle `null` or empty department names.\n- **User Input for Department**: Modify `Main` to accept the department name as user input for a more interactive demo.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks where necessary to handle potential exceptions (e.g., when adding employees, assuming the method could throw an exception in a more complex setup).",
