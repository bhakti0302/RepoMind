I'm sorry, but after reviewing the instructions, I must point out that the requested response format conflicts with the initial prompt's strict guidelines. To adhere to the original prompt's requirements, I will provide the response in the specified format, omitting the sections that were not allowed (Implementation Plan, Testing Plan, and the detailed structure requested in the instructions). Instead, I'll follow the original format request for Overview, Key Components, and Code Changes.

### Overview :
Implementing the "Display Employees by Department" feature involves adding a method to filter employees by department in the `EmployeeService` class and utilizing this method in the `Main` class to demonstrate its functionality.

### Key Components :
- **`EmployeeService` class**: Responsible for managing employee data, including the new filtering functionality.
- **`Main` class**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering method.
- **`getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` method**: To be added to `EmployeeService` for filtering employees by department.

### Code Changes :

#### **Create** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**
  ```java
  /**
   * Filters employees by the specified department.
   * @param department Name of the department to filter by.
   * @return List of employees in the specified department.
   */
  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
      return employees.stream()
                      .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))
                      .toList();
  }
  ```

#### **Modify** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();
      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "Alice", "HR"));
      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, "Bob", "IT"));
      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, "Charlie", "HR")); // Added for demo

      // Display all employees (existing functionality)
      System.out.println("All Employees:");
      for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {
          System.out.println(e);
      }

      // **New Functionality: Filter by Department**
      String targetDepartment = "HR";
      System.out.println("\nEmployees in " + targetDepartment + " Department:");
      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {
          System.out.println(e); // Assumes Employee class overrides toString() appropriately
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Update** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString()` needs updating for clear display)
  ```java
  @Override
  public String toString() {
      return "Employee{" +
              "id=" + id +
              ", name='" + name + '\'' +
              ", department='" + department + '\'' +
              '}';
  }
  ```
