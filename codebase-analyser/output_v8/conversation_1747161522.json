  "response": "Given the constraints in your prompt, I'll adhere strictly to the requested format for the **Code Changes** section, as the other sections (Overview, Key Components, Detailed Implementation Steps, Code Examples for Critical Parts beyond the specified format, Testing Approach) are either not required or explicitly disallowed. I'll provide a brief overview and key components for context before diving into the code changes as per your format request.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves adding a method to filter employees by department in the `EmployeeService` class and utilizing this method in the `Main` class.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **Employee.java**: Holds employee data.\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Manages employee data, including the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Create to** `com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n// New method to get employees by department\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify to** `com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\n// Assuming getter for department is not present, add it\npublic String getDepartment() {\n    return department;\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update to** `com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\n// Within main method, after adding employees\nString targetDepartment = \"HR\"; // Example department\nList<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\ndepartmentEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(\"Name: \" + employee.getName() + \", ID: \" + employee.getId() + \", Role: \" + employee.getRole()));\n```\n\n#### **Note on Employee Role**:\n- The `Employee` class does not currently have a `role` attribute or getter based on provided documents. To display role as per **Display Details** requirement:\n  - **Add to** `com/company/model/Employee.java`:\n    ```java\n    private String role;\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n        this.role = role;\n    }\n\n    public String getRole() {\n        return role;\n    }\n    ```\n  - **Update** employee additions in `Main.java` to include role:\n    ```java\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    ```",
