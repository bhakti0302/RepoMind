  "response": "Since the prompt explicitly asks to follow a specific format with **Code Changes** and **not** to provide an implementation plan, testing plan, or the originally requested structure (1-5), I'll adhere to the requested format while incorporating essential details for clarity. Note that I'll provide a brief overview and key components for context, as they seem implied to be part of the setup for the **Code Changes** section, even though not explicitly requested.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **`EmployeeService` Class**: Responsible for managing employee data and providing filtered lists.\n- **`Main` Class**: Utilizes `EmployeeService` to add employees and display those filtered by department.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### Create to `com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Fetches employees belonging to a specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employee objects in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n}\n```\n\n#### Add to `com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't already defined for proper display)\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // **Note: 'role' attribute not shown in initial Employee constructor, assume it exists or add it**\n            '}';\n}\n```\n#### **Correction to the Above Addition** (Since `role` wasn't in the initial `Employee` constructor, let's **Create** a more accurate `toString` and possibly **Modify** the `Employee` constructor if `role` is indeed a requirement):\n##### **Modify** `com/company/model/Employee.java` (Constructor and Adding `role` if necessary)\n```java\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) { // **Modified Constructor if 'role' is to be included**\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role; // **New line if 'role' is added**\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            // Uncomment if 'role' is indeed an attribute: + \", role='\" + role + '\\'' +\n            '}';\n}\n```\n\n#### Update to `com/company/app/Main.java` (Demonstrating department filter usage)\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Assuming 'role' is now included**\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    List<Employee> hrEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : hrEmployees) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Insert** (If not already present) to `com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` (Import for `Collectors`)\n```java\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n```",
