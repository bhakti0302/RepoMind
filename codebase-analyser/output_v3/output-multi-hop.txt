Full Business Requirement:
Business Requirement: Display Employees by Department

Objective:
Allow the system to list all employees belonging to a specific department.

Functional Requirements:
1. Filter by Department
   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., "Engineering", "HR").
   - The system should display all employees working in that department.

2. Display Details
   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.

Suggested Code Enhancements:
- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.
- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.

Prompt: Only give the output path files and the code that needs to be modified in it.
Do not give testing approach or anything.
The output should be in this format :
  Craete to path_of the file 
  ```java
    // Your code here
  ```

 Add to path_of the file 
  ```java
    // Your code here
  ```

  Modify to path_of the file 
  ```java
    // Your code here
  ```
  Update to path_of the file 
  ```java
    // Your code here
  ```
  Insert to path_of the file 
  ```java
    // Your code here
  ```
  Structure the output in this format. You can use other synonyms for the above keywords but strictly follow the format.
