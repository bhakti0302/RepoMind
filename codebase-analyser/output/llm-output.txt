Given the strict format requirement for the response and the instruction to not provide a testing approach or implementation plan (contrary to the final instructions listed, which seem to be an oversight given the initial constraints), I'll align the response with the **initial format** you provided, focusing on **Code Changes** as that's where the action items are, and then briefly address the overlooked instructions in a condensed manner at the end for completeness, without elaborating on testing or detailed implementation plans.

### Overview :
Implementing the "Display Employees by Department" feature involves updating the existing `EmployeeService` class to include a department filtering method and modifying the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.

### Key Components :
- **EmployeeService.java**: Handles employee data and operations.
- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the application's functionality.

### Code Changes :

#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**
```java
/**
 * Retrieves a list of employees filtered by the specified department.
 * @param department Name of the department to filter by.
 * @return List of Employees in the specified department.
 */
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
    return employees.stream()
            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))
            .toList();
}
```

#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` 
**(Assuming `getDepartment()`, `getName()`, `getId()`, and `getRole()` are not already defined, add them)**

```java
public String getDepartment() {
    return department;
}

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public int getId() {
    return id;
}

// Assuming 'role' is not defined in the constructor, add it to the class and its getter
private String role;

public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.department = department;
    this.role = role;
}

public String getRole() {
    return role;
}
```

#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` 
**(To demonstrate the new filtering functionality and display details)**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();
    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "Alice", "HR", "Manager"));
    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, "Bob", "IT", "Developer"));
    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, "Charlie", "HR", "Assistant"));

    System.out.println("Employees in HR Department:");
    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment("HR")) {
        System.out.println("Name: " + e.getName() + ", ID: " + e.getId() + ", Role: " + e.getRole());
    }
}
```

### **Condensed Response to Overlooked Instructions for Completeness**

#### 1. **Overview of the Implementation Approach**
- **Service Layer Enhancement**: Enhance `EmployeeService` for filtering.
- **Demonstration in Main**: Update `Main` to show the new functionality.

#### 2. **Key Components and Their Responsibilities**
- **Already Covered Above**

#### 3. **Detailed Implementation Steps**
1. **Enhance `EmployeeService`** with `getEmployeesByDepartment`.
2. **Ensure `Employee` has Necessary Getters**.
3. **Update `Main` for Demonstration**.

#### 4. **Code Examples for Critical Parts**
- **Already Provided Above**

#### 5. **Testing Approach** (Brief, as per initial instruction to not provide)
- **Unit Test for `getEmployeesByDepartment`**: Verify correct filtering by department.
- **Integration Test in `Main`**: Manually verify output for HR department matches expectations. 

**Note**: The above response prioritizes the initial format request. For a detailed implementation plan or testing approach, please request separately.
