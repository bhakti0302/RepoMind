  "response": "I'll follow the original format you requested for the **Code Changes** section since the new format you provided at the end (with Overview, Key Components, etc.) seems to be an oversight given the initial instructions. However, to accommodate both, I'll provide a brief overview and key components as requested in the new format, followed by the detailed **Code Changes** in the original requested format, and then the remaining sections as per your new instructions.\n\n### 1. Overview of the Implementation Approach\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to include a department-based filtering method and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### 2. Key Components and Their Responsibilities\n- **Employee.java**: Holds employee data (already implemented).\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Manages employee data, to be enhanced for department filtering.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n\n### 3. Detailed Implementation Steps\nRefer to **Code Changes** below for step-by-step implementation details.\n\n### 4. Code Examples for Critical Parts\nEmbedded within **Code Changes**.\n\n### 5. Testing Approach\n*(As per your request, this section is omitted. Normally, you would include test cases here to validate the functionality.)*\n\n### Code Changes\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves all employees belonging to a specified department.\n * \n * @param department Name of the department to filter by\n * @return List of employees in the given department\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't properly defined for display)\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // **Assumption**: Role attribute exists\n            '}';\n}\n// **Action Required**: Ensure `role` attribute exists in `Employee` class. If not, add it.\n// Example:\n// private String role;\n// public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n//     this.id = id;\n//     this.name = name;\n//     this.department = department;\n//     this.role = role;\n// }\n// public String getRole() { return role; }\n```\n\n#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Assumption**: Role added\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\"; // Example department filter\n    List<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : departmentEmployees) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Note on Missing `role` Attribute in `Employee` Class**\n- **Action**: If the `Employee` class does not have a `role` attribute, **Create** it by adding a `role` field, its getter, and updating the constructor to accept and set the `role`.\n\n#### **Create (If Necessary)** in `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role;\n}\n\npublic String getRole() {\n    return role;\n}\n```",
