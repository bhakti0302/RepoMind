Here is the structured response as requested:

### 1. Overview of the Implementation Approach

* **Approach**: Enhance the existing `EmployeeService` class with a new method to filter employees by department, leveraging the Service Layer Pattern for encapsulation.
* **Scope**: Modifications are confined to the `EmployeeService` class and the `Main` class for demonstration.
* **Technology/Programming Language**: Assuming Java based on the provided code snippets.

### 2. Key Components and Their Responsibilities

| **Component** | **Responsibility** |
| --- | --- |
| `EmployeeService` | Manage employee data, including filtering by department. |
| `Main` | Demonstrate the usage of `getEmployeesByDepartment` method. |
| `Employee` | Represents an employee with ID, name, and department. |

### 3. Detailed Implementation Steps

#### **Step 1: Enhance `EmployeeService` with `getEmployeesByDepartment`**

* **File Path**: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`
* **Action**:
  1. Add a new method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` to `EmployeeService`.
  2. Implement the method to filter `employees` list based on the `department` parameter.

#### **Step 2: Modify `Main` for Demonstration**

* **File Path**: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`
* **Action**:
  1. Prompt the user to input a department name.
  2. Call `getEmployeesByDepartment` with the user's input.
  3. Display the returned employees' details (ID, Name, Role - assuming "Role" is implied by the department or can be added as an `Employee` attribute if missing).

#### **Step 3: Ensure `Employee` Class Supports Requirements**

* **File Path**: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`
* **Action** (if not already present):
  1. Verify `Employee` has `id`, `name`, and `department` attributes with appropriate getters.
  2. **Optional but Recommended for Clarity**: Add a `role` attribute if "Role" is distinct from department (not explicitly mentioned in requirements but inferred from "Display Details").

### 4. Code Examples for Critical Parts

#### **`EmployeeService.java` Enhancements**

```java
public class EmployeeService {
    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

    // Existing methods...

    /**
     * Filters employees by the specified department.
     * @param department Department name to filter by.
     * @return List of employees in the specified department.
     */
    public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
        return employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))
                .toList(); // Java 16+; for earlier versions, use .collect(Collectors.toList())
    }
}
```

#### **`Main.java` Demonstration**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();
        service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "Alice", "HR"));
        service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, "Bob", "IT"));
        service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, "Charlie", "HR")); // Additional for demo

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter Department: ");
        String department = scanner.nextLine();

        List<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(department);

        if (!departmentEmployees.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Employees in " + department + " Department:");
            departmentEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println("ID: " + employee.getId() + ", Name: " + employee.getName() + ", Department: " + employee.getDepartment()));
        } else {
            System.out.println("No employees found in the " + department + " department.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### **`Employee.java` (Assuming `role` is not needed as per original specs, but adding for completeness)**

```java
public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
    // private String role; // Uncomment and add getter/setter if 'role' is distinct from department

    public Employee(int id, String name, String department/*, String role*/) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        // this.role = role; // Uncomment if 'role' is used
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getId() { return id; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getDepartment() { return department; }
    // public String getRole() { return role; } // Uncomment if 'role' is used
}
```

### 5. Testing Approach

* **Unit Testing**:
  * **Test Case 1**: `getEmployeesByDepartment` with an existing department.
  * **Test Case 2**: `getEmployeesByDepartment` with a non-existing department.
  * **Test Case 3**: Edge case with multiple employees in the same department.
  * **Tool**: JUnit
  * **Example for Test Case 1**:
    ```java
    @Test
    public void testGetEmployeesByExistingDepartment() {
        EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();
        service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "Test", "IT"));
        
        List<Employee> employees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment("IT");
        assertNotNull(employees);
        assertEquals(1, employees.size());
        assertEquals("IT", employees.get(0).getDepartment());
    }
    ```
* **Integration Testing**:
  * **Scenario**: Run the `Main` class, input a department, verify the output matches expectations.
  * **Tool**: Manual Testing or Selenium for GUI (if applicable, not indicated here)
