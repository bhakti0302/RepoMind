  "response": "Given the strict format requirement for the response and the instruction to not provide a testing approach or implementation plan (contrary to the final instructions listed, which seem to be an oversight given the initial constraints), I'll align the response with the **initial format** you provided, focusing on **Code Changes** as that's where the action items are, and then briefly address the overlooked instructions in a condensed manner at the end for completeness, without elaborating on testing or detailed implementation plans.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves updating the existing `EmployeeService` class to include a department filtering method and modifying the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Handles employee data and operations.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the application's functionality.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees filtered by the specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employees in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` \n**(Assuming `getDepartment()`, `getName()`, `getId()`, and `getRole()` are not already defined, add them)**\n\n```java\npublic String getDepartment() {\n    return department;\n}\n\npublic String getName() {\n    return name;\n}\n\npublic int getId() {\n    return id;\n}\n\n// Assuming 'role' is not defined in the constructor, add it to the class and its getter\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role;\n}\n\npublic String getRole() {\n    return role;\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` \n**(To demonstrate the new filtering functionality and display details)**\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in HR Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"HR\")) {\n        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: \" + e.getRole());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Condensed Response to Overlooked Instructions for Completeness**\n\n#### 1. **Overview of the Implementation Approach**\n- **Service Layer Enhancement**: Enhance `EmployeeService` for filtering.\n- **Demonstration in Main**: Update `Main` to show the new functionality.\n\n#### 2. **Key Components and Their Responsibilities**\n- **Already Covered Above**\n\n#### 3. **Detailed Implementation Steps**\n1. **Enhance `EmployeeService`** with `getEmployeesByDepartment`.\n2. **Ensure `Employee` has Necessary Getters**.\n3. **Update `Main` for Demonstration**.\n\n#### 4. **Code Examples for Critical Parts**\n- **Already Provided Above**\n\n#### 5. **Testing Approach** (Brief, as per initial instruction to not provide)\n- **Unit Test for `getEmployeesByDepartment`**: Verify correct filtering by department.\n- **Integration Test in `Main`**: Manually verify output for HR department matches expectations. \n\n**Note**: The above response prioritizes the initial format request. For a detailed implementation plan or testing approach, please request separately.",
