  "response": "Given the strict format requirement and the explicit instructions to **not** provide an implementation plan, testing approach, or fill in all sections unless necessary, I will adhere to the specified format focusing only on **Code Changes** as requested, along with a brief **Overview** and **Key Components** for contextual clarity.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: To house the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: To utilize the new method for department-based employee listing.\n- **Employee.java**: Already has the necessary structure (department attribute).\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employee objects in the given department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\n// Assuming getter for department is not present, add it\npublic String getDepartment() {\n    return department;\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Additional for demo\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\"; // Department to filter by\n    List<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    departmentEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(\"Name: \" + employee.getName() + \", ID: \" + employee.getId() + \", Role: Not Implemented (Assumed constant or to be added)\"));\n}\n```\n\n#### **Note on Role Display**:\n- The `Employee` class does not have a `role` attribute in the provided snippets. To display roles as per the business requirement, add a `role` field to `Employee.java` along with its getter, and then modify the print statement in `Main.java` to include `employee.getRole()`. \n\n**Example Addition to `Employee.java` for Role (Not Requested but Necessary for Full Requirement Fulfillment)**:\n```java\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role;\n}\n\npublic String getRole() {\n    return role;\n}\n```",
