  "response": "However, based on your initial prompt, you requested a specific format for the response that differs from the \"Instructions\" section you later provided. To honor both while prioritizing the initial format request (since the \"Instructions\" seem to be a subsequent addition without an explicit request to change the format), I'll provide the response in the **initial requested format** followed by a brief alignment with the \"Instructions\" for completeness, without the testing approach as per your request.\n\n### **Initial Requested Format Response**\n\n#### Overview :\nImplementing the `getEmployeesByDepartment` functionality in the `EmployeeManager` class (assumed to be `EmployeeService` based on provided documents) to filter employees by department.\n\n#### Key Components :\n- `EmployeeService` class\n- `Main` class (for demonstration)\n\n#### Code Changes :\n\n* **Modify** `EmployeeService.java` (path: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`)\n  ```java\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      return employees.stream()\n              .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n              .toList();\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **Modify** `Employee.java` (path: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`) to override `toString` for better display:\n  ```java\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n      return \"Employee{\" +\n              \"id=\" + id +\n              \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n              \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n              \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // Assuming 'role' exists, if not, add it\n              '}';\n  }\n  ```\n  **Note**: If `role` does not exist in `Employee.java`, **Add** it:\n  ```java\n  private String role;\n  \n  public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n      this.id = id;\n      this.name = name;\n      this.department = department;\n      this.role = role;\n  }\n  // Getters and Setters for role\n  ```\n\n* **Update** `Main.java` (path: `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`) to demonstrate the new functionality:\n  ```java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // Assuming role is added\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n      String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n      System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n          System.out.println(e);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### **Brief Alignment with \"Instructions\" (without Testing Approach)**\n\n#### 1. **Overview of the Implementation Approach**\nUtilize the Service Layer Pattern to add a department filtering method in `EmployeeService`, leveraging Java Streams for simplicity.\n\n#### 2. **Key Components and Their Responsibilities**\n- **`EmployeeService`**: Manages employee data, including filtering by department.\n- **`Main`**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n\n#### 3. **Detailed Implementation Steps**\n(Already provided in the **Code Changes** section above)\n\n#### 4. **Code Examples for Critical Parts**\n(Already provided in the **Code Changes** section above)\n\n#### 5. **Testing Approach**\n*Not Provided as per Request*",
