Filter by Department\n   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\", \"HR\").\n   - The system should display all employees working in that department.\n\n2. Display Details\n   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.\n\nSuggested Code Enhancements:\n- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.\n- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.\n\nPrompt:\nThe output should be in this format :\n\nOverview :\n\n\nKey Components :\n\n\nCode Changes :\n  Create to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n Add to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n  Modify to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Update to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Insert to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\nDo not give testing approach.\nDO NOT give implementation plan or testing plan.\nJust fill the parts in the above format that have code changes according to you.\nYou do not need to fill all the above parts , just the one that needs to be changed. \nIf there are any other changes that needs to be done, other than Create, Add, Modify, Update, Insert, then you can use other keywords.\nStructure the output in this format. You can use other synonyms for the above keywords but strictly follow the format.\n\n# Context\n\n--- Document 1: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\n--- Document 2: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n--- Document 3: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\n\n\n        for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n\n--- Document 4: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n\n--- Document 5: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\n\n--- Document 6: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nBased on the provided requirements and context, implement the necessary code changes.\n\nPlease provide your implementation in the following format:\n\n## File: [file_path]\n\n```[language]\n// Your code here\n```\n\n",
  "response": "### Overview :\nThe system will be enhanced to display employees by department, allowing users to filter by department name and view corresponding employee details.\n\n### Key Components :\n- `EmployeeManager` class with `getEmployeesByDepartment` method\n- Enhanced `Main` class for demonstration\n- Utilization of existing `EmployeeService` for employee data\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Create** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeManager.java**\n```java\npackage com.company.service;\n\nimport com.company.model.Employee;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n    private EmployeeService employeeService;\n\n    public EmployeeManager(EmployeeService employeeService) {\n        this.employeeService = employeeService;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all employees belonging to a specific department.\n     * \n     * @param department Name of the department\n     * @return List of Employees in the department\n     */\n    public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n        return employeeService.getAllEmployees().stream()\n                .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeManager;\nimport com.company.model.Employee;\n\n// Assuming 'service' is an instance of EmployeeService already present in Main\nEmployeeManager employeeManager = new EmployeeManager(service);\n\n// Example usage after the existing loop\nSystem.out.println(\"Employees by Department Demo:\");\nString targetDepartment = \"Engineering\"; // Example department\nList<Employee> employeesInDepartment = employeeManager.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\nif (!employeesInDepartment.isEmpty()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : employeesInDepartment) {\n        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: \" + e.getRole());\n    }\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"No employees found in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department.\");\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming this file exists based on context, modifying to ensure department, name, id, and role are accessible)\n```java\npackage com.company.model;\n\npublic class Employee {\n    private String name;\n    private String id;\n    private String role;\n    private String department; // Ensure this field exists\n\n    // Existing constructors...\n\n    public String getDepartment() {\n        return department;\n    }\n\n    public void setDepartment(String department) {\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public String getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public String getRole() {\n        return role;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` (No direct code change needed based on provided requirements, but ensuring the context is clear)\n```java\n// No changes directly required here based on the given instructions\n// Ensure employees list is properly populated with Employee objects containing department info\n```\n\n#### **Insert** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` (Before the existing loop for demo clarity, or where appropriate for user input)\n```java\n// For dynamic department input (instead of hardcoding \"Engineering\")\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\n// ...\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter Department Name: \");\nString targetDepartment = scanner.nextLine();\nscanner.close();\n\n// The rest of the example usage code (as added above) follows here...\n```",
