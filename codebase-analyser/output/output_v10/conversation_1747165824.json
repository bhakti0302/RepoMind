  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the instruction to only provide code changes in a specific format without implementation plans, testing approaches, etc., I'll adapt the response to fit as closely as possible while still being informative. Since the format provided in the prompt doesn't fully align with the \"Instructions\" section's request for a detailed, numbered approach, I'll prioritize the initial format for **Code Changes** as requested, followed by a brief, non-detailed overview and key components for context. The \"Detailed Implementation Steps\" and \"Code Examples\" will be merged into the **Code Changes** section due to format constraints, and **Testing Approach** is omitted as per instructions.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and modifying the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- `EmployeeService` class\n- `Main` class\n- `Employee` class (assuming it has a `toString` method for printing details, or this will need to be added)\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specific department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employee objects in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` to Demonstrate Department Filtering\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Additional employee for demo\n\n    System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Ensure** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` has a `toString` Method for Printing\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            '}';\n}\n```\n**Note:** If the `Employee` class already has a `toString` method that suits your needs, this step is unnecessary. \n\n### Detailed Implementation Steps & Code Examples :\n*Embedded within the Code Changes section above due to format constraints.*\n\n### Testing Approach :\n**Omitted as per instructions.**",
