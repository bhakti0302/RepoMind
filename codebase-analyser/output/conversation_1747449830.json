  "response": "Since the original prompt and instructions conflict (the prompt asks for a specific output format without implementation plan, testing, etc., while the instructions ask for a detailed implementation plan), I will provide **two responses** to cater to both requests:\n\n---\n\n### **Response 1: Adhering to the Original Prompt Format**\n\n#### Overview :\n\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature.\n\n#### Key Components :\n\n- `EmployeeService` class\n- `Main` class\n\n#### Code Changes :\n\n  **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n  ```java\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      return employees.stream()\n              .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n              .toList();\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n  ```java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n      System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n          System.out.println(e);\n      }\n      \n      String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n      System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \":\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n          System.out.println(String.format(\"Name: %s, ID: %d, Role: %s\", e.name, e.id, e.department)); // Assuming 'role' is not available, using department as placeholder\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Note**: Since the `Employee` class's `toString()` method isn't provided, and there's no explicit `role` attribute (assuming department serves as a placeholder for role in this context), the print statement in `Main` class is adjusted accordingly. **Implement `toString()` in `Employee.java` for cleaner output**:\n  ```java\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n      return String.format(\"Name: %s, ID: %d, Department: %s\", name, id, department);\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **Response 2: Following the Instructions for Detailed Implementation Plan**\n\n#### 1. Overview of the Implementation Approach\n\n* **Pattern**: Utilize the Service Layer Pattern for encapsulating employee data access and operations.\n* **Language/Technologies**: Assuming Java based on provided code snippets.\n* **Key Task**: Implement `getEmployeesByDepartment` in `EmployeeService` and demonstrate its use in `Main`.\n\n#### 2. Key Components and Their Responsibilities\n\n| **Component** | **Responsibilities** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `EmployeeService` | Manage employee data, provide filtering by department |\n| `Main` | Demonstrate the usage of `getEmployeesByDepartment` |\n| `Employee` | Hold employee details (ID, Name, Department, implicitly Role if distinct from Department) |\n\n#### 3. Detailed Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Enhance `EmployeeService`**:\n   - Add `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` method.\n2. **Update `Main` for Demonstration**:\n   - Call `getEmployeesByDepartment` with a sample department.\n   - Print the results.\n\n#### 4. Code Examples for Critical Parts\n\n##### **`EmployeeService.java` Enhancement**\n\n```java\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    /**\n     * Returns a list of employees belonging to the specified department.\n     * @param department Department name\n     * @return List of matching employees\n     */\n    public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n        return employees.stream()\n                .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n                .toList();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### **`Main.java` Update**\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Existing employee additions...\n\n        // Demonstrate department filtering\n        String targetDept = \"HR\";\n        List<Employee> deptEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDept);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDept + \":\");\n        deptEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(\n            String.format(\"Name: %s, ID: %d, Department: %s\", \n            employee.name, employee.id, employee.department)));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### **Suggested Enhancement for `Employee.java` (if not already present)**\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return String.format(\"Name: %s, ID: %d, Department: %s\", name, id, department);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Testing Approach\n\n* **Unit Testing**:\n  - Test `getEmployeesByDepartment` with various departments (existing, non-existing).\n  - Verify case insensitivity.\n* **Integration Testing** (within `Main` or a dedicated test class):\n  - Validate the output for a known set of employees.\n  - Edge case: Empty department list. \n\n**Note**: Detailed testing code and more comprehensive instructions on setting up tests (e.g., using JUnit) are not provided here due to the format constraints but are highly recommended for a production-ready implementation.",
