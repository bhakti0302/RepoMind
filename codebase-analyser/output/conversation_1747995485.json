  "response": "I'll follow the format you requested for the **Code Changes** section as closely as possible, given the constraints. Since the original prompt and the instructions seem to diverge in format requirements, I'll provide both a response to the original prompt's format for **Code Changes** and then address the **Instructions** in a more detailed, numbered format as requested.\n\n### **Response to Original Prompt Format (Code Changes)**\n\n**Overview**: Implementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature.\n\n**Key Components**: `EmployeeService` class, `Main` class, `getEmployeesByDepartment` method.\n\n**Code Changes**:\n\n* **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n  ```java\n  /**\n   * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.\n   * @param department Name of the department.\n   * @return List of Employee objects in the department.\n   */\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      return employees.stream()\n              .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n              .toList();\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **Modify to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't already implemented to show details as required)\n  ```java\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n      return \"Employee{\" +\n              \"id=\" + id +\n              \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n              \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n              \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // Assuming 'role' exists, if not, add it\n              '}';\n  }\n  // If 'role' doesn't exist in Employee class, add:\n  // private String role;\n  // public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) { ... }\n  // public String getRole() { return role; }\n  ```\n\n* **Update to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n  ```java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // Assuming role is added\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n      System.out.println(\"Employees in HR Department:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"HR\")) {\n          System.out.println(e);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### **Instructions (Detailed, Numbered Format)**\n\n#### 1. **Overview of the Implementation Approach**\nImplement the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature by enhancing the `EmployeeService` class with a filtering method and updating the `Main` class for demonstration. Utilize Java 8 streams for efficient filtering.\n\n#### 2. **Key Components and Their Responsibilities**\n- **`EmployeeService` Class**: Manages employee data, including filtering by department.\n- **`Main` Class**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n- **`Employee` Class**: Holds employee details (ensure it includes `role` if not already present).\n\n#### 3. **Detailed Implementation Steps**\n\n| Step | Action | File Path |\n|-----|-------|----------|\n| 1   | Add `getEmployeesByDepartment` | `/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` |\n| 2   | Implement `toString` in `Employee` (if missing) | `/com/company/model/Employee.java` |\n| 3   | Update `Main` for demonstration | `/com/company/app/Main.java` |\n| 4   | (Optional) Add `role` to `Employee` if missing | `/com/company/model/Employee.java` |\n\n#### 4. **Code Examples for Critical Parts**\n Provided in the **Code Changes** section above.\n\n#### 5. **Testing Approach**\n *NOT PROVIDED AS PER REQUEST* \n\n### **Additional Notes for Completion**\n\n- **Role Addition in Employee Class**: If the `Employee` class does not have a `role` attribute, add it along with its getter and constructor parameter.\n  \n  ```java\n  public class Employee {\n      // Existing fields...\n      private String role;\n      \n      public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n          this.id = id;\n          this.name = name;\n          this.department = department;\n          this.role = role;\n      }\n      \n      public String getRole() {\n          return role;\n      }\n      // ...\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Error Handling**: Consider adding basic error handling (e.g., checking for `null` department names in `getEmployeesByDepartment`) for robustness.\n\n  ```java\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      if (department == null || department.isEmpty()) {\n          throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Department name cannot be empty or null.\");\n      }\n      // Existing implementation...\n  }\n  ```",
