  "response": "Given the strict format requirement for the answer and the instructions provided, I'll adjust the response to first comply with the initial format for **Code Changes** (as per the first prompt) and then address the **Instructions** in a separate section below it, adapting to the requested structure for that part.\n\n### Code Changes\n\n**Overview**: Implementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature.\n\n**Key Components**: `EmployeeService` class, `Main` class.\n\n**Code Changes**:\n \n* **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**\n  ```java\n  /**\n   * Retrieves all employees belonging to a specific department.\n   * @param department Name of the department.\n   * @return List of Employees in the specified department.\n   */\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      return employees.stream()\n                      .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equals(department))\n                      .toList();\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't properly defined for display purposes)\n  ```java\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n      return \"Employee{\" +\n              \"id=\" + id +\n              \", name='\" + name + \"'\" +\n              \", department='\" + department + \"'\" +\n              \", role='\" + role + \"'}\"; // **Note:** `role` attribute assumed, not shown in provided code.\n  }\n  ```\n  **Correction Needed for Above**: Since the `role` attribute wasn't provided in the `Employee` class constructor or fields in the given documents, you should either:\n  - **Add** a `role` field to `Employee.java` if it's a requirement:\n    ```java\n    private String role;\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n        this.role = role;\n    }\n    ```\n    And update the `toString` method accordingly.\n  - **Modify** the `toString` to only include available fields if `role` isn't a requirement:\n    ```java\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n      return \"Employee{\" +\n              \"id=\" + id +\n              \", name='\" + name + \"'\" +\n              \", department='\" + department + \"'}\";\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` to demonstrate filtering\n  ```java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Assuming role added**\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n      String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n      System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n          System.out.println(e);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Instructions for Implementation\n\n#### 1. Overview of the Implementation Approach\n- **Pattern**: Utilize the Service Layer Pattern for encapsulating employee data access and operations.\n- **Approach**: Extend the existing `EmployeeService` to include department-based filtering, leveraging Java Streams for simplicity and readability.\n\n#### 2. Key Components and Their Responsibilities\n- **`EmployeeService` Class**:\n  - Manages the list of employees.\n  - Provides methods for adding employees and retrieving employees by department.\n- **`Employee` Class**:\n  - Holds individual employee data (ID, Name, Department, Role).\n  - Properly overrides `toString` for meaningful output.\n- **`Main` Class**:\n  - Demonstrates the usage of `EmployeeService`, especially the new filtering capability.\n\n#### 3. Detailed Implementation Steps\n1. **Enhance `Employee` Class (if necessary)**: Ensure it includes all required attributes (e.g., `role`) and a suitable `toString` method.\n2. **Extend `EmployeeService`**:\n   - Add the `getEmployeesByDepartment` method.\n3. **Update `Main` for Demonstration**:\n   - Showcase adding employees across different departments.\n   - Filter and display employees from a specific department using the new method.\n\n#### 4. Code Examples for Critical Parts\n- **Already Provided in \"Code Changes\" Section**\n\n#### 5. Testing Approach\n- **Not Provided as Per Instruction** \n\n**Note**: For the `Employee` class modification regarding the `role` attribute, choose the approach that best fits your application's requirements. If `role` is not needed, simply adjust the `toString` method to exclude it.",
