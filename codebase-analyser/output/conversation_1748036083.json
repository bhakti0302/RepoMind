  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the instruction to **only fill the parts that need code changes** without providing implementation plans, testing approaches, or filling all sections if unnecessary, I'll adapt the response to fit as closely as possible while still conveying the necessary information for the code changes.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation involves enhancing the existing `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and modifying the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Will house the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: Will be updated to use the new filtering method.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### Add to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.\n * \n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employee objects in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### Modify `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` \n**(Assuming `toString()` isn't defined for detailed display, if already defined, skip this)**\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // **Assumption: 'role' field exists**\n            '}';\n}\n```\n**Note**: If the `role` field does not exist in the `Employee` class, you will need to **Add** it:\n```java\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role;\n}\n```\n\n#### Update `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Updated with role**\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));   // **Updated with role**\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\")); // **New entry for demo**\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in HR Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"HR\")) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Insert** (if not already present) in `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`\n**(Only if `role` field doesn't exist, as mentioned above)**\n\n```java\nprivate String role;\n\npublic String getRole() {\n    return role;\n}\n\npublic void setRole(String role) {\n    this.role = role;\n}\n```\n**And update the constructor as shown in the Modify section above.**",
