Filter by Department\n   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\", \"HR\").\n   - The system should display all employees working in that department.\n\n2. Display Details\n   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.\n\nSuggested Code Enhancements:\n- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.\n- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.\n\nPrompt:\nThe output should be in this format :\n\nOverview :\n\n\nKey Components :\n\n\nCode Changes :\n  Create to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n Add to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n  Modify to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Update to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Insert to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\nDo not give testing approach.\nDO NOT give implementation plan or testing plan.\nJust fill the parts in the above format that have code changes according to you.\nYou do not need to fill all the above parts , just the one that needs to be changed. \nIf there are any other changes that needs to be done, other than Create, Add, Modify, Update, Insert, then you can use other keywords.\nStructure the output in this format.

  "response": "## Overview\nThe system will be enhanced to display employees by department through the implementation of a filtering method in the `EmployeeService` class and its utilization in the `Main` class.\n\n## Key Components\n- **EmployeeService Class**: Will contain the new method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` for filtering employees.\n- **Main Class**: Will be updated to demonstrate the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n\n## Code Changes\n\n### Create to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeManager.java`\n```java\nimport com.company.model.Employee;\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class EmployeeManager {\n    private EmployeeService employeeService;\n\n    public EmployeeManager(EmployeeService employeeService) {\n        this.employeeService = employeeService;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all employees belonging to a specific department.\n     * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n     * @return List of employees in the specified department.\n     */\n    public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n        return employeeService.getAllEmployees().stream()\n                .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Modify to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n(No direct modification needed for the new requirement, but ensuring the class is as follows for context)\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Update to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\nimport com.company.model.Employee;\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeManager;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n        EmployeeManager manager = new EmployeeManager(service);\n        \n        // Example employees for demonstration\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"John Doe\", \"Engineering\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Jane Doe\", \"HR\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Bob Smith\", \"Engineering\"));\n\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter Department Name: \");\n        String department = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        List<Employee> employeesInDepartment = manager.getEmployeesByDepartment(department);\n\n        if (!employeesInDepartment.isEmpty()) {\n            System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + department + \" Department:\");\n            for (Employee e : employeesInDepartment) {\n                System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: \" + e.getDepartment());\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"No employees found in the \" + department + \" department.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Insert to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (if `getRole()` is not present and assumed needed based on \"Display Details\" requirement)\n(Assuming `getRole()` is not available and needs to be added for the \"Role\" display, which seems to be a misunderstanding since \"role\" isn't defined in provided context but \"department\" is. If \"role\" is indeed a separate attribute, add this; otherwise, ignore or adjust accordingly)\n\n```java\n// Assuming a new attribute 'role' is needed (NOT PRESENT IN ORIGINAL CONTEXT, ADJUST ACCORDINGLY)\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role; // New\n}\n\npublic String getRole() { return role; } // New\n```\n**Important Note**: The insertion above for `getRole()` and the `role` attribute is speculative based on the \"Display Details\" requirement mentioning \"role\", which is not defined in the provided context. If \"role\" is not a separate attribute from \"department\" in your system, this insertion should be ignored or adjusted to reflect your actual model (e.g., using `getDepartment()` if that's the intended \"role\" in the display requirement). \n\nGiven the original context does not support \"role\" as a separate entity from \"department\", the `Main.java` update above uses `getDepartment()` for display purposes, aligning with provided specifications. \n\n### Example Use Case (Implicit in `Main.java` Update):\n1. Run the `Main` class.\n2. When prompted, enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\").\n3. The system will display all employees in the specified department, including their name, ID, and department (treated as \"role\" in the display for this example due to the context provided).",
