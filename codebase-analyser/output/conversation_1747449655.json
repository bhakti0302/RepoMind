  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the instruction to focus only on code changes without testing or implementation plans, I'll adapt the response to fit as closely as possible while providing essential clarity. Since the format provided in the prompt doesn't perfectly align with the \"Instructions\" section's request for a structured response with an overview, key components, detailed steps, code examples, and testing approach (which is explicitly excluded), I'll merge the necessary information into the requested format with a focus on code changes as instructed.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation involves adding a department-based filtering capability to the existing Employee Management System.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Will house the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering capability.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Filters employees by department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of employees in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\n// Assuming toString is not defined, add for better console output\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            '}';\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n    System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Note on** `Employee.java` (No Change Required, but for Clarity)\n- Ensure `department` field is accessible (at least package-private or with a getter) for the filter to work in `EmployeeService`. If not, **Add a Getter**:\n```java\npublic String getDepartment() {\n    return department;\n}\n```\nAnd **Modify** the `getEmployeesByDepartment` method to use the getter:\n```java\n.filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n```\n\n### Detailed Implementation Steps & Code Examples :\n- **Step 1**: Implement `getEmployeesByDepartment` in `EmployeeService` (Shown Above)\n- **Step 2**: Enhance `Employee`'s `toString` for readable output (Shown Above)\n- **Step 3**: Demonstrate filtering in `Main` (Shown Above)\n\n### Testing Approach : \n**(Explicitly Excluded by Request)**",
