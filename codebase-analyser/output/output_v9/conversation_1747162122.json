Filter by Department\n   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\", \"HR\").\n   - The system should display all employees working in that department.\n\n2. Display Details\n   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.\n\nSuggested Code Enhancements:\n- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.\n- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.\n\nPrompt:\nThe output should be in this format :\n\nOverview :\n\n\nKey Components :\n\n\nCode Changes :\n  Create to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n Add to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n  Modify to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Update to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Insert to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\nDo not give testing approach.\nDO NOT give implementation plan or testing plan.\nJust fill the parts in the above format that have code changes according to you.\nYou do not need to fill all the above parts , just the one that needs to be changed. \nIf there are any other changes that needs to be done, other than Create, Add, Modify, Update, Insert, then you can use other keywords.\nStructure the output in this format.

  "response": "**Overview**:\nTo fulfill the business requirement of displaying employees by department, we will introduce a new method in the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and modify the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n**Key Components**:\n- `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` method in `EmployeeService`\n- Integration in `Main` class for department-based employee listing\n\n**Code Changes**:\n\n### **Create** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\n// Assuming Employee class doesn't have a 'department' field and 'toString' override for display\npublic class Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private String role; // New field for role\n    private String department; // New field for department\n\n    // Constructor with new fields\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String role, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.role = role;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    // Getters\n    public int getId() { return id; }\n    public String getName() { return name; }\n    public String getRole() { return role; }\n    public String getDepartment() { return department; }\n\n    // Override toString for easier printing\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee{\" +\n               \"id=\" + id +\n               \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n               \", role='\" + role + '\\'' +\n               \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n               '}';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Modify** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    // ... (existing code remains)\n\n    /**\n     * Filters employees by the specified department.\n     * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n     * @return List of employees in the specified department.\n     */\n    public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n        return employees.stream()\n                .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n                .toList();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Update** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n        // Updated with 'role' and 'department'\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"Manager\", \"HR\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"Developer\", \"IT\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"Assistant\", \"HR\")); // Additional for demo\n\n        // Demonstrate filtering by department\n        String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n        System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n        for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
