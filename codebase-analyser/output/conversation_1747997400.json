  "response": "I'll follow the **original format** you provided for the response since the **new instructions** seem to be an addition that might not align with your initial request to avoid implementation/test plans and stick to a specific format. However, I'll include both to ensure compliance with all requests:\n\n---\n\n### **Original Format Response (as initially requested)**\n\nOverview :\n> Enhancing the Employee Management System to display employees by department.\n\nKey Components :\n> - `EmployeeService` class, `Main` class, `Employee` class\n\nCode Changes :\n  **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n  ```java\n  /**\n   * Retrieves all employees belonging to a specific department.\n   * @param department Name of the department\n   * @return List of Employees in the department\n   */\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      return employees.stream()\n              .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n              .toList();\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `getDepartment()` isn't present)\n  ```java\n  public String getDepartment() {\n      return department;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` to demonstrate usage\n  ```java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Additional for demo\n\n      System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n          System.out.println(e);\n      }\n      \n      String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n      System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n          System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: Not Implemented Yet\"); // Role not in original Employee class\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Insert** `getName()` and `getId()` in `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` if not present\n  ```java\n  public int getId() {\n      return id;\n  }\n  \n  public String getName() {\n      return name;\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **Response to New Instructions (for completeness, though not initially requested)**\n\n#### 1. Overview of the Implementation Approach\n- **Pattern**: Service Layer Pattern for encapsulating employee data access.\n- **Approach**: Enhance the `EmployeeService` to filter employees by department and update the `Main` class for demonstration.\n\n#### 2. Key Components and Their Responsibilities\n- **`EmployeeService`**: Manages employee data, including filtering by department.\n- **`Employee`**: Holds employee information (ID, Name, Department).\n- **`Main`**: Demonstrates the usage of `getEmployeesByDepartment`.\n\n#### 3. Detailed Implementation Steps\n1. **Enhance `EmployeeService`**:\n   - Add `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` method.\n2. **Ensure `Employee` Class Accessibility**:\n   - Verify or add getter methods for `id`, `name`, and `department`.\n3. **Update `Main` for Demonstration**:\n   - Call `getEmployeesByDepartment` with a sample department.\n\n#### 4. Code Examples for Critical Parts\n**(Already Provided in the Original Format Response)**\n\n#### 5. Testing Approach\n**(Not Requested in Original Prompt, but Included for New Instructions Compliance)**\n- **Unit Test for `getEmployeesByDepartment`**:\n  - Test with an existing department.\n  - Test with a non-existing department.\n  - Test with mixed case department names (given the use of `equalsIgnoreCase`).\n- **Integration Test in `Main`**:\n  - Verify output for a known department matches expected employees. \n\n**Example Unit Test (Simplified, assuming JUnit)**\n\n```java\n@Test\npublic void testGetEmployeesByDepartmentExisting() {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Test\", \"IT\"));\n    List<Employee> employees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"IT\");\n    assertEquals(1, employees.size());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testGetEmployeesByDepartmentNonExisting() {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    List<Employee> employees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"Finance\");\n    assertTrue(employees.isEmpty());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testGetEmployeesByDepartmentCaseInsensitive() {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Test\", \"it\"));\n    List<Employee> employees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"IT\");\n    assertEquals(1, employees.size());\n}\n```",
