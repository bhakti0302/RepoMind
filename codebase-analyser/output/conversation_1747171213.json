  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the instruction to only fill in the parts that need code changes (without testing approach, implementation plan, etc.), I'll adapt the response to fit as closely as possible while providing essential information for the code changes. Since the format provided in the prompt doesn't perfectly align with the \"Instructions\" section's request for a detailed, numbered approach, I'll merge the requirements to provide a concise answer that focuses on the code changes as requested, followed by a brief overview and key components for context.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **Employee.java**: Holds employee data.\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Manages employee data, including the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Create to** `com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Filters employees by the specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of employees in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify to** `com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\n// Assuming getters are not present, add them for accessibility\npublic int getId() { return id; }\npublic String getName() { return name; }\npublic String getDepartment() { return department; }\n```\n\n#### **Update to** `com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    List<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n    \n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    departmentEmployees.forEach(employee -> \n        System.out.println(\"ID: \" + employee.getId() + \", Name: \" + employee.getName() + \", Role: \" + employee.getRole()));\n}\n```\n\n#### **Insert to** `com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `role` is needed but not provided in the constructor or fields)\n```java\nprivate String role;\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role;\n}\n\npublic String getRole() { return role; }\n```\n**Note:** The insertion of `role` related code is an assumption since the original `Employee` class details were incomplete regarding the `role` attribute. If `role` is already handled, this step can be ignored.\n\n#### **Update to** `com/company/app/Main.java` (Continuation for Role Display, if the above insertion is applied)\n```java\n// Within the departmentEmployees.forEach loop\nSystem.out.println(\"ID: \" + employee.getId() + \", Name: \" + employee.getName() + \", Role: \" + employee.getRole());\n```\n\n**Important Clarification for `role` Attribute:**\n- **If `role` is already defined** in `Employee.java` with appropriate getters/setters, **ignore** the `Insert to` section for `role`.\n- **If `role` is not defined**, apply the `Insert to` change to include `role` in the `Employee` class for completeness, as the business requirement implies displaying the role.\n\n### Detailed Implementation Steps & Code Examples for Critical Parts:\n- **Step 1**: Enhance `EmployeeService` with `getEmployeesByDepartment`.\n  - **Code**: Provided in **Create to** section.\n- **Step 2**: Ensure `Employee` has necessary getters.\n  - **Code**: Provided in **Modify to** section.\n- **Step 3**: Update `Main` to demonstrate filtering.\n  - **Code**: Provided in **Update to** section.\n\n### [Omitted as per Instructions]\n- **4. Testing Approach**\n- **5. (Implicit in Code Changes)** Detailed Implementation Steps beyond code snippets.",
