Filter by Department\n   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\", \"HR\").\n   - The system should display all employees working in that department.\n\n2. Display Details\n   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.\n\nSuggested Code Enhancements:\n- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.\n- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.\n\nPrompt:\nThe output should be in this format :\n\nOverview :\n\n\nKey Components :\n\n\nCode Changes :\n  Create to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n Add to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n  Modify to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Update to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Insert to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\nDo not give testing approach.\nDO NOT give implementation plan or testing plan.\nJust fill the parts in the above format that have code changes according to you.\nYou do not need to fill all the above parts , just the one that needs to be changed. \nIf there are any other changes that needs to be done, other than Create, Add, Modify, Update, Insert, then you can use other keywords.\nStructure the output in this format. You can use other synonyms for the above keywords but strictly follow the format.\n\n# Context\n\n--- Document 1: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\n--- Document 2: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n--- Document 3: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\n\n\n        for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n\n--- Document 4: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n\n--- Document 5: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\n\n--- Document 6: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n}\n\n--- Document 7: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n        service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n\n        for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n--- Document 8: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npackage com.company.service;\n\nimport com.company.model.Employee;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nBased on the provided requirements and context, implement the necessary code changes.\n\nPlease provide your implementation in the following format:\n\n## File: [file_path]\n\n```[language]\n// Your code here\n```\n\n",
  "response": "Based on the provided requirements and context, here are the necessary code changes to implement the \"Display Employees by Department\" functionality:\n\n### Overview :\nThe system will be enhanced to display employees by their department through the addition of a method in `EmployeeService` and its utilization in the `Main` class.\n\n### Key Components :\n- `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` method in `EmployeeService`\n- Department-based employee listing in `Main`\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Create** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` \n(Assuming `Employee` class exists but its details aren't fully provided, adding department as a property if not already present)\n\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private String department; // Assuming this property exists, if not, add it\n    private String role;\n\n    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n        this.role = role;\n    }\n\n    public String getDepartment() {\n        return department;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public String getRole() {\n        return role;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee{\" +\n                \"id=\" + id +\n                \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n                \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n                \", role='\" + role + '\\'' +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` \n\n```java\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` \n(Enhancing `main` method to demonstrate department filtering)\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n    System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: \" + e.getRole());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` \n(No direct update needed beyond the 'Add' section, but ensuring the class header is correct)\n\n```java\npackage com.company.service;\n\nimport com.company.model.Employee;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    // The 'getEmployeesByDepartment' method added above\n}\n```\n\n#### **Insert** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` \n(Not necessary as modifications cover the requirement, but for clarity, no additional insertions beyond the Modify section)\n\n*No Code Here as 'Modify' Covers the Necessary Changes*",
