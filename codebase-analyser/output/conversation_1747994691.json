  "prompt": "# Requirements\n\nBusiness Requirement: Display Employees by Department\n\nObjective:\nAllow the system to list all employees belonging to a specific department.\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n1. Filter by Department\n   - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., \"Engineering\", \"HR\").\n   - The system should display all employees working in that department.\n\n2. Display Details\n   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.\n\nSuggested Code Enhancements:\n- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.\n- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.\n\nPrompt:\nThe output should be in this format :\n\nOverview :\n\n\nKey Components :\n\n\nCode Changes :\n  Create to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n Add to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n\n  Modify to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Update to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\n  Insert to path_of the file \n  ```\n    // Your code here\n  ```\nDo not give testing approach.\nDO NOT give implementation plan or testing plan.\nJust fill the parts in the above format that have code changes according to you.\nYou do not need to fill all the above parts , just the one that needs to be changed. \nIf there are any other changes that needs to be done, other than Create, Add, Modify, Update, Insert, then you can use other keywords.\nStructure the output in this format. You can use other synonyms for the above keywords but strictly follow the format.\n\n# Context\n\n--- Document 1: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\n--- Document 2: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n--- Document 3: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\n\n\n        for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n\n--- Document 4: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n\n--- Document 5: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java ---\n\nimport com.company.service.EmployeeService;\n\n--- Document 6: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java ---\n\npublic String getDepartment() { return department; }\n\n--- Document 7: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java ---\n\n\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n--- Document 8: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java ---\n\npublic class Employee {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private String department;\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() { return id; }\n    public String getName() { return name; }\n    public String getDepartment() { return department; }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee{id=\" + id + \", name='\" + name + \"', department='\" + department + \"'}\";\n    }\n}\n\n--- Document 9: /Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java ---\n\npublic class EmployeeService {\n    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {\n        employees.add(employee);\n    }\n\n    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {\n        return employees;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nBased on the provided requirements and context, implement the necessary code changes.\n\nPlease provide your implementation in the following format:\n\n## File: [file_path]\n\n```[language]\n// Your code here\n```\n\n",
