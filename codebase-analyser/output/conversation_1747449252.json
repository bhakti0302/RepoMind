  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the explicit instructions to **not** provide an implementation plan, testing approach, or fill all parts if unnecessary, I'll adapt the response to fit the requested format while addressing the query's core: providing code changes for the specified business requirement. Since the original prompt and the \"Instructions\" section seem to conflict in requirements, I'll prioritize the initial format request but highlight key points from the instructions where relevant.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation focuses on adding department-based filtering to the Employee Management System.\n\n### Key Components :\n- `EmployeeService` class (for business logic)\n- `Main` class (for demonstration)\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### Add to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.\n * \n * @param department Name of the department to filter by\n * @return List of Employees in the specified department\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equals(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### Modify `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't properly defined for display purposes)\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            \", role='\" + role + '\\'' +  // **Assumption: Role attribute exists**\n            '}';\n}\n// **If 'role' doesn't exist, add it to the Employee class**\n// private String role;\n// public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n//     this.id = id;\n//     this.name = name;\n//     this.department = department;\n//     this.role = role;\n// }\n// public String getRole() { return role; }\n```\n\n#### Update `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` to demonstrate filtering\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Assuming role is added**\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in HR Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(\"HR\")) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Note on Instructions Compatibility**\n- **Overview & Key Components**: Provided above for context, though not strictly requested.\n- **Detailed Implementation Steps & Code Examples**: Embedded within the **Code Changes** section for brevity and to meet the primary format requirement.\n- **Testing Approach**: Explicitly excluded by the original prompt.",
