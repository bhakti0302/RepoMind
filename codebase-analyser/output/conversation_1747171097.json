  "response": "I must point out that the instructions explicitly state to **not** provide a testing approach, implementation plan, or fill in all parts if not necessary, instead focusing on the specific format provided for code changes. Given this, and to adhere strictly to your format and instructions, I'll adjust the response to fit what's required while highlighting the discrepancy for sections not requested.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation focuses on enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **Employee.java**: Holds employee data.\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Manages employee data, including the new filtering functionality.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the new functionality.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**\n```java\n/**\n * Filters employees by the specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of employees in the specified department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\"; // Department to filter by\n    List<Employee> departmentEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    departmentEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(\"Name: \" + employee.name + \", ID: \" + employee.id + \", Role: \" + employee.role));\n}\n```\n\n#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `role` needs to be displayed and isn't currently in the constructor or class)\n```java\npublic class Employee {\n    // Existing fields and constructor\n    public String role; // **NEW FIELD FOR ROLE**\n\n    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.department = department;\n        this.role = role; // **INITIALIZE ROLE**\n    }\n\n    // toString method for easier printing (if not already present)\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Employee{\" +\n                \"id=\" + id +\n                \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n                \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n                \", role='\" + role + '\\'' +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n```\n**Note on Update**: This assumes `role` was not previously part of the `Employee` class. If it was, this step is unnecessary. Also, update the `addEmployee` calls in `Main.java` to include roles for completeness:\n```java\nservice.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\"));\nservice.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\nservice.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n```\n\n### **Additional Note for Compliance with Original Instructions**:\n- **Steps 1 (Overview), 2 (Key Components), and the request for \"Detailed implementation steps\" and \"Code examples for critical parts\"** are partially addressed above to provide context while focusing on the **Code Changes** as per your strict format request.\n- **Step 5 (Testing Approach)** and a full **Implementation Plan** are **not provided** as per your instructions. \n\n### **To Fully Align with Your Original Format Request (Simplified)**\n\n### Overview : \n(Provided above for context)\n\n### Key Components : \n(Provided above for context)\n\n### Code Changes :\n(Provided above with necessary changes)",
