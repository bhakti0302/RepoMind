Since the format provided doesn't align perfectly with the detailed instructions, I'll use the \"Code Changes\" section to encapsulate the necessary actions, using the provided keywords where applicable and adding brief explanations for clarity.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation of \"Display Employees by Department\" functionality through targeted code enhancements.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Enhancement for department-based filtering.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstration of the new filtering functionality.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add** to `com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.\n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employee objects in the given department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't already defined for display purposes)\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // **Assumption**: Role attribute exists\n            '}';\n}\n// **ACTION REQUIRED**: Ensure `role` attribute is defined if not already present.\n```\n\n#### **Update** `com/company/app/Main.java` to Demonstrate Filtering\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Assumption**: Role added\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\"));\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n        System.out.println(e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Note on Employee Model Enhancement (Implicit in Modify above)**\n- **Ensure `role` Attribute Exists in `Employee.java`**:\n  ```java\n  public class Employee {\n      // Existing attributes...\n      private String role;\n\n      public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n          this.id = id;\n          this.name = name;\n          this.department = department;\n          this.role = role; // Initialize role\n      }\n\n      // Getters and Setters...\n      public String getRole() { return role; }\n      public void setRole(String role) { this.role = role; }\n  }\n  ```",
