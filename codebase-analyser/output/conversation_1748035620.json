  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the explicit instructions to **not** provide an implementation plan, testing plan, or fill all parts if unnecessary, I'll tailor the response to fit the specified format while addressing the core request for code changes based on the analysis. Since the detailed steps and testing approach are excluded by request, here's the response focusing on the **Code Changes** section with essential context:\n\n### Overview :\nImplementing the \"Display Employees by Department\" feature involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class and utilizing it in the `Main` class.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Will host the department filtering logic.\n- **Main.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the new filtering functionality.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**\n```java\n/**\n * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.\n * \n * @param department Name of the department to filter by.\n * @return List of Employee objects in the given department.\n */\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .collect(Collectors.toList());\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` **(Assuming `toString()` isn't defined for desired output)**\n```java\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Employee{\" +\n            \"id=\" + id +\n            \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n            \", department='\" + department + '\\'' +\n            \", role='\" + role + '\\'' + // **Assumption**: Role attribute exists\n            '}';\n}\n// **If 'role' doesn't exist, add it to the Employee class**\n// private String role;\n// public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n//     this.id = id;\n//     this.name = name;\n//     this.department = department;\n//     this.role = role;\n// }\n// public String getRole() { return role; }\n```\n\n#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` **to demonstrate `getEmployeesByDepartment` usage**\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\", \"Manager\")); // **Updated with role**\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\", \"Developer\"));   // **Updated with role**\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\", \"Assistant\")); // **Added for demo**\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n    List<Employee> hrEmployees = service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment);\n\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    hrEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n```\n\n#### **Note on Missing `role` Attribute in Original `Employee` Constructor/Class**:\n- **Action Required**: If the `Employee` class does not have a `role` attribute, **Add** it to the class (constructor, field, and getter as shown in the modified `toString()` comment above). \n- **Example Addition to `Employee.java`** (if `role` is not present):\n  ```java\n  private String role;\n  \n  public Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n      this.id = id;\n      this.name = name;\n      this.department = department;\n      this.role = role;\n  }\n  \n  public String getRole() {\n      return role;\n  }\n  ```",
