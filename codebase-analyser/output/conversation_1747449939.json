  "response": "Given the strict format requirements and the instruction to focus only on code changes without testing, implementation plan, or other non-requested sections, I'll adapt the response to fit as closely as possible while providing essential information for the code changes. Since the format provided in the prompt doesn't align perfectly with the \"Instructions\" section you've outlined, I'll merge the necessary information into the requested format with a brief overview and then focus on the code changes as instructed.\n\n### Overview :\nImplementation involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.\n\n### Key Components :\n- **EmployeeService.java**: Will contain the new filtering method.\n- **Main.java**: Will be updated to use the new method.\n\n### Code Changes :\n\n#### **Create** to `com/company/service/EmployeeService.java` \n*(No new file needed, but for clarity, this indicates we're adding to an existing file)*\n```java\npublic List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n    return employees.stream()\n            .filter(employee -> employee.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n            .toList();\n}\n```\n**Note**: Ensure `Employee` class has a `getDepartment()` method. If not:\n#### **Add** to `com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\npublic String getDepartment() {\n    return department;\n}\n```\n\n#### **Modify** to `com/company/app/Main.java` \n*(Update the `main` method to demonstrate the new functionality)*\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n    String targetDepartment = \"HR\"; // Department to filter by\n    System.out.println(\"Employees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n        System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.getName() + \", ID: \" + e.getId() + \", Role: \" + e.getRole());\n    }\n}\n```\n**Note**: If `Employee` doesn't have `getName()`, `getId()`, or `getRole()` methods:\n#### **Insert** to `com/company/model/Employee.java`\n```java\npublic int getId() {\n    return id;\n}\n\npublic String getName() {\n    return name;\n}\n\npublic String getRole() { // Assuming role is stored or a placeholder\n    return role; // **NOTE**: This assumes a 'role' field exists. If not, you must add it to the Employee class.\n}\n```\n**Important**: The `getRole()` method assumes there's a `role` field in the `Employee` class. If this field doesn't exist, you'll need to add it to the class constructor, fields, and the `getRole()` method accordingly.\n\n#### **Update** to `com/company/model/Employee.java` (if `role` field doesn't exist)\n```java\nprivate String role; // Add to fields\n\npublic Employee(int id, String name, String department, String role) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.department = department;\n    this.role = role; // Update constructor\n}\n\n// Then, the getRole() method as above\n```",
