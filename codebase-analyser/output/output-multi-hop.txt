Full Business Requirement:
Business Requirement: Display Employees by Department

Objective:
Allow the system to list all employees belonging to a specific department.

Functional Requirements:
1. Filter by Department

   - The system should display all employees working in that department.

2. Display Details
   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.

Suggested Code Enhancements:
- Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class.
- Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.

Prompt:
The output should be in this format :
