Given the strict format requirements and the explicit instruction to **only** fill in the parts of the provided format that have code changes (without providing testing approach, implementation plan, etc.), I will adhere to the format for the **Code Changes** section, as that's where the direct action items based on the analysis are expected. Since the other sections (Overview, Key Components) are not explicitly requested to be filled with content beyond the format and the main task is code changes, I'll focus on that. For completeness and to assist in understanding, I've also briefly outlined the **Overview** and **Key Components** in a minimal manner, but the primary response is the **Code Changes** section.

### Overview :
Implementation involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees by department and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality.

### Key Components :
- **EmployeeService.java**: To house the filtering logic.
- **Main.java**: To showcase the department-based employee listing.

### Code Changes :

#### **Add** to `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**
```java
/**
 * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specified department.
 * 
 * @param department Name of the department to filter by.
 * @return List of Employee objects in the given department.
 */
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
    return employees.stream()
            .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

#### **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/model/Employee.java` (Assuming `toString` isn't properly defined for clear output)
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Employee{" +
            "id=" + id +
            ", name='" + name + '\'' +
            ", department='" + department + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```

#### **Update** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java` (Main method for demonstration)
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();
    service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "Alice", "HR"));
    service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, "Bob", "IT"));
    service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, "Charlie", "HR")); // Additional for demo

    System.out.println("All Employees:");
    for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }

    String targetDepartment = "HR";
    System.out.println("\nEmployees in " + targetDepartment + " Department:");
    for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

#### **Insert** (No direct 'Insert' action identified from the requirements beyond the above additions/modifications)

### Notes:
- Ensure `import java.util.stream.Collectors;` is added to `EmployeeService.java` for the `getEmployeesByDepartment` method to work.
- The `toString` method in `Employee.java` is assumed not to be fully defined for clear output in the console. If already defined similarly, this step can be skipped.
- **Testing Approach**, **Detailed Implementation Steps**, and **Code Examples for Non-Critical Parts** are omitted as per the instructions. 

### Additional Required Imports (to be added where necessary, e.g., in `EmployeeService.java`):
```java
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
```
