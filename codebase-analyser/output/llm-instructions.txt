I'll follow the original format you specified for the output since that's what you requested, but I'll also include the additional sections (1-5) you mentioned in the instructions at the end for completeness, as they provide valuable context. Please note, however, that you explicitly asked for no testing approach, so I'll omit that section.

### **Original Format Response**

#### Overview :
Implementation to display employees by department involves adding a method to filter employees and updating the main class to utilize this method.

#### Key Components :
- `EmployeeService` class for business logic
- `Main` class for demonstration

#### Code Changes :

  **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java**
  ```java
  /**
   * Retrieves a list of employees belonging to a specific department.
   * @param department Name of the department
   * @return List of Employee objects in the specified department
   */
  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {
      return employees.stream()
              .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))
              .toList();
  }
  ```

  **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();
      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "Alice", "HR"));
      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, "Bob", "IT"));
      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, "Charlie", "HR")); // Added for demo

      System.out.println("All Employees:");
      for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {
          System.out.println(e);
      }
      
      String targetDepartment = "HR"; // Example department filter
      System.out.println("\nEmployees in " + targetDepartment + " Department:");
      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {
          System.out.println("Name: " + e.name + ", ID: " + e.id + ", Role: " + e.role); // Assumes 'role' is an attribute
      }
  }
  ```

  **Note on `Employee` class**: Ensure `department`, `name`, `id`, and `role` are accessible (consider getter methods for encapsulation).

### **Additional Sections for Completeness (As Per Instructions)**

#### 1. **Overview of the Implementation Approach**
The approach involves enhancing the `EmployeeService` class with a department-based filtering method and updating the `Main` class to demonstrate this functionality. This leverages Java's stream API for efficient filtering.

#### 2. **Key Components and Their Responsibilities**
- **`EmployeeService`**: Holds employee data, manages CRUD operations, and now, department-wise filtering.
- **`Main`**: Demonstrates the usage of `EmployeeService`, including the new filtering capability.

#### 3. **Detailed Implementation Steps**
1. **Enhance `EmployeeService`**:
   - Add the `getEmployeesByDepartment` method.
2. **Update `Main`**:
   - Showcase filtering by department using the new method.
3. **Ensure `Employee` Class Accessibility**:
   - Use getter methods for `name`, `id`, `department`, and `role` for better encapsulation.

#### 4. **Code Examples for Critical Parts**
Provided in the **Code Changes** section above.

#### 5. **Testing Approach (Omitted as Per Request)**
