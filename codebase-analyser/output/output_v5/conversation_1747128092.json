  "response": "I'm sorry, but after reviewing the instructions, I must politely decline to provide a response in the format you initially requested due to conflicting instructions in your prompt. However, I will provide the response in the format you **initially** requested (Overview, Key Components, Code Changes) and then, separately, address the **later** instruction format (1. Overview, 2. Key Components, 3. Detailed Implementation Steps, 4. Code Examples, 5. Testing Approach) **without** the testing approach as per your initial strict request.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Request Format**\n\n#### Overview :\nImplementing the `getEmployeesByDepartment` method in `EmployeeService` to filter employees by department and utilizing it in `Main`.\n\n#### Key Components :\n- `EmployeeService.java`\n- `Main.java`\n- `Employee.java` (for context, no changes required)\n\n#### Code Changes :\n\n  **Add to** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/service/EmployeeService.java`\n  ```java\n  public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(String department) {\n      return employees.stream()\n              .filter(employee -> employee.department.equalsIgnoreCase(department))\n              .toList();\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Modify** `/Users/bhaktichindhe/Desktop/Project/EmployeeManagementSystem/src/com/company/app/Main.java`\n  ```java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n      EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService();\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(1, \"Alice\", \"HR\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(2, \"Bob\", \"IT\"));\n      service.addEmployee(new Employee(3, \"Charlie\", \"HR\")); // Added for demo\n\n      System.out.println(\"All Employees:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getAllEmployees()) {\n          System.out.println(e);\n      }\n      \n      String targetDepartment = \"HR\";\n      System.out.println(\"\\nEmployees in \" + targetDepartment + \" Department:\");\n      for (Employee e : service.getEmployeesByDepartment(targetDepartment)) {\n          System.out.println(\"Name: \" + e.name + \", ID: \" + e.id + \", Role: \" + e.role); // Assumes 'role' exists in Employee\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  **Note on `Employee.java`**: The code snippet assumes `role` is a field in `Employee`. If not, you'll need to **Add** it:\n  ```java\n  public class Employee {\n      // ...\n      private String role; // Constructor and getters/setters as appropriate\n      // ...\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### **Later Request Format (Minus Testing Approach)**\n\n#### 1. **Overview of the Implementation Approach**\nImplement the `getEmployeesByDepartment` method in the `EmployeeService` class to filter employees based on the department. Utilize this method in the `Main` class to demonstrate functionality.\n\n#### 2. **Key Components and Their Responsibilities**\n- **`EmployeeService.java`**: Manages employee data, including filtering by department.\n- **`Main.java`**: Demonstrates the usage of `EmployeeService`, including the new filtering functionality.\n- **`Employee.java`**: Holds employee data (no changes required unless adding a `role` field).\n\n#### 3. **Detailed Implementation Steps**\n1. **Add Method to `EmployeeService`**:\n   - Open `EmployeeService.java`.\n   - Implement `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` using Java Streams for filtering.\n\n2. **Utilize New Method in `Main`**:\n   - Open `Main.java`.\n   - After adding employees, call `getEmployeesByDepartment` with a target department.\n   - Print the results, displaying name, ID, and role for each matching employee.\n\n3. **(Optional) Add `role` to `Employee` if Necessary**:\n   - If `Employee` lacks a `role` field, add it along with a constructor parameter and appropriate getters/setters.\n\n#### 4. **Code Examples for Critical Parts**\n**(Already Provided in the Initial Request Format Section)**\n\n#### 5. **(Omitted as Per Initial Request)** \nTesting Approach is not provided as per your strict request.",
