# User Authentication System Requirements

## Overview
Implement a user authentication system with login, logout, and password reset functionality. The system should use JWT tokens for authentication and store user data in a database.

## Functional Requirements

1. User Registration
   - Allow users to register with email and password
   - Validate email format and password strength
   - Check for duplicate emails
   - Send verification email

2. User Login
   - Authenticate users with email and password
   - Generate JWT token upon successful login
   - Include user role in the token payload
   - Set appropriate token expiration

3. User Logout
   - Invalidate JWT token
   - Clear client-side session data

4. Password Reset
   - Allow users to request password reset via email
   - Generate secure reset tokens with expiration
   - Validate reset tokens
   - Allow users to set new passwords

5. User Profile
   - Allow users to view their profile information
   - Allow users to update profile details
   - Require authentication for profile access

## Technical Requirements

1. Security
   - Hash passwords using bcrypt
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Sanitize all user inputs

2. Performance
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Ensure response times under 200ms

3. Scalability
   - Design for horizontal scaling
   - Use stateless authentication

4. Compatibility
   - Support modern browsers
   - Provide API endpoints for mobile applications

## Implementation Details

The authentication system should be implemented as a separate service that can be integrated with other parts of the application. It should provide clear API endpoints for all functionality.
