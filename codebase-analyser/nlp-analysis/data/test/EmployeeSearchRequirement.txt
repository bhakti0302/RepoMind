Query: Business Requirement: Employee Search Functionality

Objective: Implement a search feature that allows users to find employees based on various criteria.

Functional Requirements:
1. Search by Name
   - Users should be able to search for employees by first name, last name, or full name
   - The search should support partial name matching (e.g., "Jo" should find "John" and "Joseph")
   - The search should be case-insensitive

2. Search by Department
   - Users should be able to filter employees by their department
   - The system should display all employees in the selected department

3. Search by Skills
   - Users should be able to search for employees with specific skills
   - The system should support searching for multiple skills at once
   - Results should be ranked by the number of matching skills

4. Search Results Display
   - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, department, and role
   - Include a profile picture if available
   - Provide an option to view the employee's full profile

Suggested Code Enhancements:
- Add a `searchEmployees(String criteria, SearchType type)` method in the `EmployeeManager` class
- Implement an enum `SearchType` with values NAME, DEPARTMENT, SKILLS, ALL
- Create a `SearchResult` class to store and rank search results
- Add a UI component for the search functionality in the main application
