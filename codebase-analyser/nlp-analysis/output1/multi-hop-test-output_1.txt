Query: Business Requirement: Display Employees by Department 
 Objective: Allow the system to list all employees belonging to a specific department.  
 Functional Requirements:
  1. Filter by Department    - Users should be able to enter a department name (e.g., "Engineering", "HR").    
  - The system should display all employees working in that department. 
   2. Display Details   
    - For each matching employee, display their name, ID, and role.  
    Suggested Code Enhancements: - Add a method `getEmployeesByDepartment(String department)` in the `EmployeeManager` class. 
    - Use this method in the main class to demonstrate filtering functionality.

Architectural Patterns:
  - Service Layer Pattern

Implementation Details:
  - EmployeeService class
  - Main class
  - getAllEmployees() method
  - EmployeeService() method
  - addEmployee() method
  - Employee() method

Related Components:
