### User Story 3: Code Generation from Requirements
**As a** developer implementing new features
**I want to** generate code based on business requirements
**So that** I can accelerate development and ensure requirements are met

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System processes requirements using NLP techniques
- System performs vector search to find relevant code context
- System uses RAG to enhance context quality
- System generates implementation instructions using LLM
- Results are displayed in the extension UI

### User Story 4: Interactive Code Merging
**As a** developer
**I want to** review and approve generated code changes before they're applied
**So that** I maintain control over code quality and implementation details

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can click "Run Merge Agent" button after code generation
- System presents each proposed change for approval
- User can approve or reject each change individually
- Approved changes are applied to the target project
- System provides a summary of applied changes

### User Story 5: Code Relationship Visualization
**As a** developer new to a project
**I want to** visualize code relationships and dependencies
**So that** I can better understand the project structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can request visualization through the extension
- System generates multi-file relationship diagrams
- System generates relationship type diagrams
- Visualizations are displayed in the chat interface
- User can open visualizations in external viewers

## Non-Functional Requirements

### User Story 6: Security of API Keys
**As a** security-conscious developer
**I want to** ensure my API keys are stored securely
**So that** sensitive credentials aren't exposed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API keys are stored in .env files
- .env files are excluded from version control
- System loads keys securely at runtime
- No keys are logged or displayed in the UI

### User Story 7: Performance Optimization
**As a** developer with a large codebase
**I want to** the system to perform efficiently even with large projects
**So that** I don't experience significant delays

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Codebase synchronization completes in reasonable time
- Vector search operations are optimized for speed
- UI remains responsive during background operations
- System provides progress indicators for long-running tasks

### User Story 8: Error Recovery
**As a** developer experiencing system issues
**I want to** receive clear error messages and recovery options
**So that** I can troubleshoot and resolve problems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System logs detailed error information
- User receives meaningful error notifications
- System suggests recovery actions when possible
- System maintains state when recoverable errors occur

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: End-to-End Requirement Implementation
**Actor:** Software Developer
**Precondition:** Extension is installed and project is open in VS Code

**Main Flow:**
1. Developer attaches business requirement document
2. System stores document and acknowledges receipt
3. Developer clicks "Sync Codebase" to ensure latest code is analyzed
4. System automatically triggers the NLP analysis pipeline
5. System performs vector search and RAG to gather context
6. System generates implementation instructions using LLM
7. Developer reviews the generated instructions
8. Developer clicks "Run Merge Agent" to apply changes
9. Developer approves/rejects each proposed change
10. System applies approved changes to the project

**Postcondition:** Business requirement is implemented in the codebase

### Use Case 2: Collaborative Development with RepoMind
**Actor:** Development Team
**Precondition:** Team members have RepoMind installed and working on same project

**Main Flow:**
1. Team member A synchronizes the codebase
2. Team member A uploads requirements for a new feature
3. System generates implementation instructions
4. Team member A reviews and applies some changes
5. Team member B continues the implementation process
6. Team member B synchronizes the updated codebase
7. Team member B runs merge agent to apply remaining changes
8. System maintains consistency across team members' work


## Additional Requirements

1. **Extensibility:** The system should support additional LLM providers beyond the current implementation.

2. **Usability:** The extension interface should be intuitive and follow VS Code UI conventions.

3. **Documentation:** The system should provide clear documentation for all features and workflows.

4. **Compatibility:** The extension should work across different operating systems where VS Code is supported.

5. **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured and documented to facilitate future enhancements.

## Project Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the development of RepoMind, we encountered several significant challenges. 
The most notable difficulty was implementing reliable event handling for dynamically generated 
UI elements like the "Run Merge Agent" button, which initially failed to trigger actions when clicked. 
We solved this by implementing a robust event attachment system that monitors DOM updates and automatically
binds event listeners to newly created elements. 
Another major challenge was ensuring consistent communication between the extension and the various 
backend components (codebase analyzer, NLP pipeline, and merge agent).
 We addressed this by implementing a standardized messaging protocol and comprehensive 
 logging system that helped identify and resolve communication breakdowns.
  The multi-hop RAG implementation presented difficulties in maintaining context quality across hops, 
  which we solved by developing a context refinement algorithm that preserves essential information while 
  reducing noise. Performance issues with large codebases were mitigated through optimization of the 
  vector search operations and implementation of incremental codebase synchronization. 
  These solutions not only resolved the immediate issues but also improved the overall architecture, 
  making the system more robust and maintainable.
